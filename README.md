# odin-recipes
My First project
I have used HTML tags, attributes and elements to build a recipe page. 
This page has main "index.html" page and then 3 recipe pages in another folder recipes. 
Also, there is an img folder which contains the images used for adding in the recipe content pages.
There are hyperlinks to navigate from home page to other pages and back.
This is the summary of the first project which I have built. Thanks!
